## Introduction

The basic idea is to implement the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) in a convolutional neural network, researching how it works, its performance and its accuracy. Users should gain some controls over the inputs to generate procedural patterns

## To-do

- [ ] Research things about WFC and its possibilities on CNN (or GAN)
